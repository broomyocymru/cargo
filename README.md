# Cargo
Cargo is a collection of demo applications written in a variety of frameworks and languages. 
Each sub project's builds are wrapped in a container, allowing us to evaluate functionality and how its affected against various PAAS, IAAS and CAAS solutions.

## Contributing
If you feel you've got some Cargo to add, fork us, create a new sub-project that can be built and run in one or more containers.
