# Cargo
Cargo is a collection demo solutions written in a variety of frameworks and languages. The aim is to create demonstrable real-life solutions that can be used as:
* a playground to experiment with new frameworks and technologies
* a demo of DevOps processes, automating integration, performance and security testing into a continuous delivery pipeline
* a benchmarking tool to compare the ever increasing range of cloud, platform and container service offerings
* a teaching tool for coding standards and architecture and polyglot design

Hopefully others can contribute their own ideas building on the existing services or creating new ones!
